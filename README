Lain
====

Lain is a tool for robust analysis of C/C++ code. It generates
abstract syntax trees, control flow graphs and a searchable index of
code constructs, even for code that would normally not compile due to
missing headers. As such, it has been specifically designed to meet
the needs of code auditors who may only have access to parts of the
code base and lack information on build requirements. Lain enables you
as a code auditor to write quick & dirty, language aware static
analysis scripts. Lain writes the information you need to disk, thus
not creating the need to learn a complicated API.
